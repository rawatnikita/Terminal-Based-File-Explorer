**TERMINAL BASED FILE EXPLORER**

This repo contains the implementation of a file explorer application,similar to the Linux file explorer ,but with limited features.

The application works in two modes : NORMAL MODE and COMMAND MODE. 

1. NORMAL MODE: The user can navigate through the directories in this mode, open files in vi editor and view the file information.

2. COMMAND MODE: The user can enter shell commands to move, copy, delete or create new files/directories. 

All commands have been implemented using system calls.
